FILE TO STORE USER STORIES


As a business owner I want to...
  * gather data on products most likely to sell
  * display three pictures side by side
  * allow users to pick favorite of 3 items
  * images to be the same size (also aspect ratio)
  * hide results from user
  * after all images are voted on, present button that allows user to view results (hidden)
  * include chart to display results using chart.js and canvas
  * I want a logo on my page.


As a developer I want to...
  * design an attractive layout
  * display three product images on screen
  * add an event handler to record which image a user clicks on
  * create an object for each image
      * image name
      * image path
      * number of clicks
      * percent of times shown image was clicked (add appearance counter)
  * all images to appear at least once.  (used_once counter + if (used_once < prod.length) then... stuff.   Add used_once to objects.)
  * cell phone functionality and design?
  * mouse over event (alt text)


As a user I want...
  * CLICK ALL THE THINGS \o/
  * CLICK MORE THINGS \o/
  * an attractive page layout
  * an easy to use UI


OTHER:
  * GIMP to edit image files ( animated gif --> jpg?)
